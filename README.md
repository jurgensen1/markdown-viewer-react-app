#Project: markdown viewer  
This is a web development project that uses the front-end framework React.  
Redux is used to manage state. It is in partial completion of freeCodeCamp's   
front-end framework certificate program.  
  
Project Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to this:  
https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/GrZVVO.  
  
## Project must: 
•	Use any mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, React, Redux, and  
jQuery to complete this project.  
•	Use a textarea element with a corresponding id="editor".  
•	Use an element with a corresponding id="preview".  
•	Use features such that when text is entered into the #editor element,  
the #preview element is updated dynamically with the text from the textarea  
element.  
•	Use a GitHub flavored markdown so that the #editor element input text is  
rendered as HTML in the #preview element.  
•	Display initial markdown when previewer first loads: a heading element  
(H1 size), a sub heading element (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block,  
a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.  
•	Display initial markdown when previewer first loads it should be rendered  
as HTML in the #preview element.
•	Use a markdown previewer that interprets carriage returns and renders them  
as br (line break) elements.
