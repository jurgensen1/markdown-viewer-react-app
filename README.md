Redux is used to manage state. It is in partial completion of freeCodeCamp's   
front-end framework certificate program.

## Requirements 
*	Use any mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, React, Redux, and  
jQuery to complete this project. 
* Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use  
whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.  
*	Use a textarea element with a corresponding id="editor".  
*	Use an element with a corresponding id="preview".  
*	Use features such that when text is entered into the #editor element,  
the #preview element is updated dynamically with the text from the textarea  
element.  
*	Use a GitHub flavored markdown so that the #editor element input text is  
rendered as HTML in the #preview element.  
*	Display initial markdown when previewer first loads: a heading element  
(H1 size), a sub heading element (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block,  
a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.  
*	Display initial markdown when previewer first loads it should be rendered  
as HTML in the #preview element.
*	Use a markdown previewer that interprets carriage returns and renders them  
as br (line break) elements.
